## Introduction

**Teamify** is a web-based collaboration and team-building platform designed to help students and developers connect, form teams, and work together efficiently on projects.

In many academic environments, students struggle to find the right teammates, manage projects, and maintain proper communication. Teamify provides a centralized platform where users can discover collaborators, create teams, manage projects, and streamline the workflow of collaborative development.

The platform aims to simulate real-world teamwork environments and improve productivity through structured collaboration.

## Problem Statement

In colleges and student communities, forming effective project teams is often challenging due to:

- Lack of a centralized system to find teammates with relevant skills  
- Poor communication between members  
- No structured task allocation or tracking  
- Difficulty managing multiple projects  
- Dependence on scattered tools like messaging apps and documents  

**Teamify solves this by providing a unified platform** where students can connect, collaborate, and manage projects in one place.
